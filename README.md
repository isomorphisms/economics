Facts I think "everyone should know". I'll try to keep it short and theory-free. That said, this is an _opinionated_ selection of facts. It will be too obvious for some but hopefully not too advanced for anyone. This is what I wish someone would have told me X years ago. Alternately, if I were teaching a course in economics 101, this is what I would build a course around. This is (a very imperfect and incomplete draft of) what I think would serve the students' rather than the teachers' interests.

I guess this is aimed at something like a 16-year-old or 19-year-old, someone without much life experience who does not deserve to be steered wrong in the self-interest of a professor's career path.

Then let's look at normal whites vs normal nonwhites.  (`tidyr`)

† the average is the total, adjusted for population size (or subpopulation, like White wealth per White)

Of course you could also look at Poc wealth growth over the generation. Wealth growth from $11k to $18k is 60% better. Nothing to sneeze at, and from 1989 to 1992 was a 72% improvement in just 3 years.

of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it
is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus
ignorant. I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his
birthday. They seldom come nearer to it than planting-time, harvest-time,
cherry-time, spring-time, or fall-time. A want of information concerning my
own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood. The white
children could tell their ages. I could not tell why I ought to be deprived
of the same privilege. I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master
concerning it. He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper
and impertinent, and evidence of a restless spirit. ―Frederick Douglass, self-taught reader and writer

If the capitalistic growth is mostly just benefiting rich white people, then I don't really see the point. In my opinion the wealth of the poor is a better gauge.

Because of the stark differences between North & South Korea, East & West Germany, Taiwan & 大陆, and pre/post Deng Xiaoping's "opening" of China, you cannot argue that capitalism does not create greater wealth than communism.

Capitalism created wealth in the 20th century. Communism created less and they had access to the same technology. Greater wealth means an easier and more comfortable life. So there is something that we want about capitalism. But what exactly is it? And how much of the bad stuff can we get rid of?

Long before the crisis of 2008, people have wanted a kinder, gentler capitalism. Does 

You don't need to adopt ad-hoc views about government versus corporate management. There might be some differences between the people who go into one versus the other, but the stereotypes about college sophomore hippies who read Saul Alinsky versus the red-blooded business students who misunderstand Gordon Gekko's purpose in _Wall Street_ (www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArS16ZyOxLQ) ---- are lazy, insufficient guides to characterise government vs business. Both are complex organisations. Both employ lazy risk-haters. Both require layers of communication and compromise. Both work with other people's money. Businessmen often serve on city councils. Etc.

A simpler reason that lawmakers shouldn't delve into the details is that it's too hard. Go to a few city council meetings wherever you live. Ask yourself if you are an expert on par with interested parties in:

- how to insulate a home
- the best kind of fire alarms
- how to design roads safely
- how to encourage both positive & negative feedback from the people you serve when you make the wrong call
- how to 


It ain't easy or fun. And people who critique politicians out of hand for being stupid are lazy non-thinkers. Inform yourself or shut up; you have the internet, so you have no excuse.

I will list several ways that various layers of US federalist government intelligently avoid making decisions they are not equipped to make. The desire to devolve decisions is in my opinion a sign of great intelligence on the part of federal and state lawmakers.

# growth & history

http://www.theworldeconomy.org/

> Over the past millennium, world population rose 22–fold. Per capita income increased 13–fold, world GDP nearly 300–fold. This contrasts sharply with the preceding millennium, when world population grew by only a sixth, and there was no advance in per capita income.

> From the year 1000 to 1820 the advance in per capita income was a slow crawl — the world average rose about 50 per cent. Most of the growth went to accommodate a fourfold increase in population.

> Since 1820, world development has been much more dynamic. Per capita income rose more than eightfold, population more than fivefold.

> Per capita income growth is not the only indicator of welfare. Over the long run, there has been a dramatic increase in life expectation. In the year 1000, the average infant could expect to live about 24 years. A third would die in the first year of life, hunger and epidemic disease would ravage the survivors. There was an almost imperceptible rise up to 1820, mainly in Western Europe. Most of the improvement has occurred since then. Now the average infant can expect to survive 66 years.

> The growth process was uneven in space as well as time. The rise in life expectation and income has been most rapid in Western Europe, North America, Australasia and Japan. By 1820, this group had forged ahead to an income level twice that in the rest of the world. By 1998, the gap was 7:1. Between the United States and Africa the gap is now 20:1. This gap is still widening. Divergence is dominant but not inexorable. In the past half century, resurgent Asian countries have demonstrated that an important degree of catch–up is feasible. Nevertheless world economic growth has slowed substantially since 1973, and the Asian advance has been offset by stagnation or retrogression elsewhere.

### Mastery of Energy

http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/ahtt.html

[[[figures]]]

> The life forms on our planet have necessarily evolved to match the
magnitude of these energy flows. But while “natural man” is in balance
with these heat flows, “technological man”1 has used his mind, his back,
and his will to harness and control energy flows that are far more intense
than those we experience naturally. To emphasize this point we suggest
that the reader make an experiment.


> Experiment 1.1
Generate as much power as you can, in some way that permits you to
measure your own work output. You might lift a weight, or run your own
weight up a stairwell, against a stopwatch. Express the result in watts (W).
Perhaps you might collect the results in your class. They should generally
be less than 1 kW or even 1 horsepower (746 W). How much less might
be surprising.

www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4O5voOCqAQ (Olympic cyclist with huge legs cannot toast a piece of toast)


> Thus, when we do so small a thing as turning on a 150 W light bulb,
we are manipulating a quantity of energy substantially greater than a
human being could produce in sustained effort. The power consumed
by an oven, toaster, or hot water heater is an order of magnitude beyond
our capacity. The power consumed by an automobile can easily be three
orders of magnitude greater. If all the people in the United States worked
continuously like galley slaves, they could barely equal the output of even
a single city power plant.
Our voracious appetite for energy has steadily driven the intensity
of actual heat transfer processes upward until they are far greater than
those normally involved with life forms on earth. Until the middle of the
thirteenth century, the energy we use was drawn indirectly from the sun
1
Some anthropologists think that the term Homo technologicus (technological man)
serves to define human beings, as apart from animals, better than the older term Homo
sapiens (man, the wise). We may not be as much wiser than the animals as we think we
are, but only we do serious sustained tool making.


> using comparatively gentle processes — animal power, wind and water
power, and the combustion of wood. Then population growth and defor-
estation drove the English to using coal. By the end of the seventeenth
century, England had almost completely converted to coal in place of
wood. At the turn of the eighteenth century, the first commercial steam
engines were developed, and that set the stage for enormously increased
consumption of coal. Europe and America followed England in these
developments.
The development of fossil energy sources has been a bit like Jules
Verne’s description in Around the World in Eighty Days in which, to win
a race, a crew burns the inside of a ship to power the steam engine. The
combustion of nonrenewable fossil energy sources (and, more recently,
the fission of uranium) has led to remarkably intense energy releases in
power-generating equipment. The energy transferred as heat in a nuclear
reactor is on the order of one million watts per square meter.

So one way to think about then versus now is that the industrial revolution gave us power generation and power consumption.

Because the extra efficiency will lower prices. Lower prices of transport or home/business/farm/industrial electricity will increase usage because of economics. So we can't necessarily solve pollution by better engineering, or at least people will work against us. On the other hand we could not rely on our intelligence to invent superior ways of doing stuff and simply invert the problem: tax electricity and you can reduce usage, without having to invent anything. This has the obvious downside that then you don't get to have as much electricity as you wanted.]]]]

Some shareholders are mutual funds, pensions, or ETF's.

Think about rice. Only if the rices are all equivalated somehow can they be mixed together and sold en masse. If they can be mixed together then third-parties can trade it even if they don't want or make rice.

For example wheat traders do not want to take delivery, they simply "make a market" for wheat. Pit traders would aggressively buy and sell slips of paper worth __ bushels of wheat to each other throughout the day, speculating on the ultimate value at delivery.

With things like steel people go to a lot of cost and might actually destroy value, to bring the steel to market. Say you have an awesome steel sculpture. If you can't find someone who agrees it is awesome and sell it to them and deliver it to them, you might melt it down so that its only value is as a commodity.

This agreement was signed by 24 stockbrokers outside of 68 Wall Street New York under a buttonwood tree.

In 1863, this name was shortened to its modern form, the "New York Stock Exchange".

###### RMBS's

It's this drive to make things exchangeable at a unified trading point that makes it so hard to get a mortgage if you're self-employed. Maybe it is or isn't true that a W-2 job is more stable than the higher-paying 1099 one you have. What is sold on (in packets of 10,000 mortgages at a time [[[link]]) and traded to third-party financial institutions is a conforming mortgage.

Local banks don't need to, themselves, hold enough money to buy every house in town. If they originate conforming mortgages and sell them on to people who *do* have boatloads of money, then they have a repeatable, scalable, fee-based business. Each conforming mortgage is so many dollars. It's a uniform process like an assembly line. It doesn't mean your job isn't valid, just that people who don't fit in the box are harder to pack together and sell as a conforming packet of 10,000.

##### Fairness

Is it unfair of them not to loan you money? If I were a conservative I would say it's their prerogative and nobody owes you a loan, however the US has laws that make certain businesses to some extent public institutions. Even if you want to rent a room in your home you are not allowed to discriminate on certain bases. [[[craigslist -- fair housing]]]

Some people like to pretend fairness isn't part of it but in a lawful society it is. We also regulate exchanges and securities offerings. You can't just do whatever you want, sort of like how you can't hire a hit man or tell certain kinds of lies with certain kinds of products. (For example you can lie about supplements all you want, but not about food or drugs.)

In general the law balances freedom with fairness. Capitalism as we know it exists only within a system of laws, and capitalism as we know it has never arisen outside a system of laws. It would be inconceivable to make the kind of money Warren Buffett has made without policies to protect fairly earned wealth. Imagine two boys playing by themselves with no adults around. They make a bet for five dollars. The one who loses refuses to pay and they punch each other. No money is exchanged. This is what I think would happen instead of a carefully regulated system of trust that is necessary for the function of exchanges like the CME. [[[[link to CME stuff




###### labour markets are not markets

If labour markets were like the CME, then you would be able to buy and sell large packs of "work units", let's say 10,000 hours per contract. It would not have to be "generic work". We don't trade "generic cows" or "generic oil" or "generic steel" either. 


For this reason I do not believe "the labour market" is a market in the usual sense of the word.


I've seen market-like things in labour. For example day-labourers will all show up at a an appointed place at 5 in the morning and then scramble for work as whoever that wants "generic manual labour" and can pay cash same-day picks them up in a truck and drives off to the job site. But I think as skills diversify even a little [[[free grou picyture]]] it stops working this way. If you're a flooring expert or an electrician or a journeyman anything, there ceases to be a gathering-market and it starts to look more like the familiar office-work pattern of sending résumés / curriculum vit&aelig; and establishing long-term relationships.

###### retail is not a market

Stores in the United States post an offer and you cannot haggle it. Bix box stores contain loads of goods from just one company. Their suppliers may compete with each other but at the consumer end once you're inside Wal Mart you are probably going to buy most of your stuff there. You would have to hoof it across town and you can't see what's in the other store so might as well go with the W. [^ This is a point where I think rationalistic economist models are irrelevant. Rational purchasing may happen over the long run ---- whatever that means --- or it may happen at the supplier level where Wal-Mart squeezes greater profits by muscling against its suppliers. However that is in the back end not at the direct consumer end.]

Stores are also "designed, not emergent". The ladies with the spices can sit wherever they want and readjust throughout the day. The buyer can saunter around. Grocery stores are the complete opposite, they have experts deciding "from the top down" [^fugly 90's speak] what to put next to each other on the shelves.

###### Bon Hiver

There are certain stories that always get told alongside a product.

Whenever anyone mentions Alfred Kinsey, they say he was an entomologist _first_ (disarming the notion he was a pervert).

Whenever anyone talks about Bon Iver's album "For Emma, Forever Ago", they mention where it was composed: in a cabin, in Wisconsin, after a breakup. The cabin-in-Wisconsin narrative (it's a little longer than what I said) sticks to your ribs. It stays with you and colours the experience of the album. I don't think the album would have worked as well without the story.

## future money
You can check right now here: http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/Historic-Yield-Data-Visualization.aspx
![yield curve](http://www.yieldandincome.com/graphing/valubond_compositeYield.asp?type=T&now=%3C?php%20print_r%28$adDateStr%29;?%3E)

![future money](future money.png)


That is the cost of future money. For example on `Sys.Date() == 2015-07-31` the yield on 1-year Treasury notes is `0.36%`, which means that $100 will become $100.36 and $10,000 will become $10,036 in one year's time. If you spent $10,000 on 1-years that day you would receive $10,036 in one year's time.


I am being inaccurate by calling it "future money" but it's close enough.

http://apps.chicagotribune.com/bond-debt/chicago-bonds.html

> About $54 million from a tax-exempt bond helped cover a legal judgment awarded to African-Americans who were denied a chance to become firefighters by a 1990s entrance exam that favored white applicants. An additional $8 million in tax-exempt bond money went to pay legal fees related to the case, records show.

> By using bond money, the city created an irony for many of those awarded damages, as their future property taxes will help pay interest on the debt. In 2033, when the city starts paying down the $54 million, interest will have more than doubled the total cost.





##### tax exempt bonds

Who benefits the most from tax breaks? Those who pay the highest tax rate. So the federal government rewards the rich if they invest in communities and localities, without asking legislators to pick winners or do due diligence.

![income distribution](http://visualeconsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2005_income_distribution.gif)

due to Catherine Mulbrandon: http://visualizingeconomics.com/blog/2006/11/05/2005-us-income-distribution

Notice that:
1. not only do half of the households get by on less than $40k / year, there arearound just a ton of people who (combined, if multiple people work in the home) earn $20k or $30k.
2. the rich live in their own world [^ I think you would need a `log(log($))` scale to fit the rich.]

People who index around $100k or complain about how there exist others who make more money than they do (doctors, corporate lawyers, investment bankers, currency traders, whatever) are living in a bubble. Normal Americans make $20k or $30k. (If you assume full-time work = 50 weeks × 40 hours/week = 2000 hours/year, then that would be $10/hour – $15/hour. Normal.)


There are some reasons the $0/year households aren't dead: they might be retired and living off of savings, or they might have negative business income for the year but generally be rich. [[mpls fed]]

Anyway. It's the $10/hr - $15/hr number that we should be interested in increasing. In a capitalist world that means empowering those people. Their productivity needs to go up and/or they need to capture more of what they already produce.

## SIC codes and NAICS



### forming a corporation



Some losers will call themselves "CEO of [0-employee company]" to try to impress you. It's not impressive. I started a company (by which I mean I filed the paperwork and paid a minimal fee). I had a couple IC's


It used to take an act of Parliament to create a limited liability company (eg, Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie). 

#### IC's versus employees

You can go to jail if you try to 1099 someone who needs a W-2. This is something you need to do our own legal reconnaissance on and take your own risks, but roughly: if you control the means, method, timing, tools, .......

I applied to a job not too long ago that required on their application form that you are OK with them paying an LLC you control. (That way they don't have to file or pay taxes; you have to do that.) I'm not a lawyer but that sounds all kinds of illegal to me. Plus the CEO seemed shady and their application questions were dumb. But anyway, just because you *might* get away with it, you might also spend half a decade in a cement cell with six walls around you and an hour in the sun every day with other convicts. Great time to read books though.

# banking

Does finance serve any useful purpose? The first way to argue it does is to think about home loans.

(The bank will repossess your house if you get too far behind on your mortgage. However they will likely take a loss so it is bad for both parties. Otherwise you could expect that banks would loan to whomever. If they could resell the house at face then a mortgage would involve no risk to them so they would just do it as much as possible.

#### aaron brown on derivatives as the new money

http://www.minyanville.com/business-news/editors-pick/articles/2527The-Physics-of-Wall-Street2527253A-The/2/4/2013/id/47671

> physical delivery is not the point of derivatives,
mark-to-market payments are. The miller in last week's example will never
deliver wheat into his futures contract; when each contract delivery comes
up he will "roll" it into a future delivery month (that is, if he has a
January contract to sell wheat, in January he will enter into a January
contract to buy wheat, offsetting his existing contract, and also enter into
an April contract to sell wheat). This is the same as a business that takes
out a money loan, when that loan comes due the business will take out a new
loan to repay it. It's not the principal that matters, it's the interest
payments. Only when businesses change or liquidate are the derivative
positions shut down and the loans repaid.

> Now we can see why derivatives are so revolutionary. It's not the ancient
notion of a fixed-price contract, it's the active exchange, the
standardization and the clearinghouse that create a new form of money.
That's what happened in 19th century in the Mississippi River system, and
again in the 1960s and '70s all over the world. This is what makes
derivatives something modern, not a 4,000-year-old concept.

> Derivatives stimulate the economy by financing businesses and facilitating
transactions, just like a banking system. We can also see why financial
engineers worked so hard from around 1965 to 1980 to replace
national-government-issued credit-backed money linked to gold with
derivative money designed after the model of futures exchanges. Milton
Friedman lobbied President Nixon to take the world off the gold standard,
Merton Miller worked hard to get approval for trading of futures and options
on financial underlyings, many other people worked to get approval of
financial institutions outside the regulated banking system to take deposits
(money market funds), make loans (mortgage lenders who securitized their
product rather than lending deposits from the public) and invest money
(public mutual index funds instead of broker-managed accounts).

> Beginning in the 1980s, another important change was redefinition of bank
capital. Credit-based bank capital is equity contributed by founders or
earned as profit. It serves to cushion credit losses. If a borrower does not




#### super-senior student loans
http://daskrap.com/2012/8/unconstitutional-40-years-war-college-students
> In December 1975, when
Congress was debating the first law that made student loans
non-dischargeable in bankruptcy, University of Connecticut law professor
Philip Shuchman testified that students “should not be singled out for
special and discriminatory treatment,” adding that the idea gave him “the
further very literal feeling that this is almost a denial of their right to
equal protection of the laws.”

[shuchman1]

> The thing was, discrimination was kinda the whole idea. Stagflation was
sending an unprecedented number of Silent Majority members into bankruptcy,
and the bank lobby was fighting back with a propaganda assault that
scapegoated counterculture student delinquents who were allegedly taking
loans with no goal of paying them. As Shuchman and others explained in
hearings, only about 4% of people who filed for bankruptcy protection in
1975 had student loans on their balance sheets, and of those fewer than one
fifth did not have substantial other debts motivating them to file.

> But try telling that to anyone who'd been reading the papers! A typical
syndicated dispatch on the surge in student deadbeats was the August 27,
1972 expose of Los Angeles Times reporter Linda Mathews, which began with
the personal anecdote of an anonymous “Washington banker” who purported to
have once “handed a $1500 check” for the year’s tuition to a nameless “
18-year-old college freshman” only to be insouciantly told, “Oh, I never
intend to repay this loan.” The kid was merely acting on the advice of “
underground newspapers,” the anonymous banker—who had since joined “the
staff of the American Banking[sic]Association”—helpfully explained.

> Credit was in general
use in ancient and in medieval times. Credit long antedated industry,
banking, and even coinage; it probably antedated primitive forms of
money. Loans at interest may be said to have begun when the Neolithic
farmer made a loan of seed to a cousin and expected more back at har-
vesttime. Be this as it may, we know that the recorded legal history of sev-
eral great civilizations started with elaborate regulation of credit.
For example, about 1800
B
.
C
., Hammurabi, a king of the first dynasty
of ancient Babylonia, gave his people their earliest known formal code of
laws. A number of the chief provisions of this code regulated the relation
of debtor to creditor. The maximum rate of interest was set at 33
1
⁄
3
% per
annum for loans of grain, repayable in kind, and at 20% per annum for
loans of silver by weight. All loans had to be accompanied by written con-
tracts witnessed before officials. If a higher than legal interest rate was
collected by subterfuge, the principal of the debt was canceled. Land and
movables could be pledged for debt, as could the person of the creditor,
his wife, concubine, children, or slaves. Personal slavery for debt, how-
ever, was limited to three years.
Twelve hundred years later, around 600
B
.
C
., the legal history of clas-
sical Greece began with the laws of Solon. At that time, drastic reforms
were necessitated by an economic crisis in Athens, stemming in part from
excessive debt and widespread personal slavery for debt. In contrast to
the Code of Hammurabi, the laws of Solon did away with all limits on the
rate of interest. They reduced or canceled many debts. They permitted
hypothecation, but they forbade personal slavery for debt. These laws
endured for centuries.
The Romans also began their legal history with a body of laws regu-
lating credit. This, too, was forced by a crisis characterized by excessive
debt. The famous semitraditional Twelve Tables, dating from around
450
B
.
C
., insofar as they deal with credit, resembled the Code of Ham-
murabi more than they did the laws of Solon. Interest on loans was limited
to no more than 8
1
⁄
3
% per annum. Higher than legal interest was penal-
ized by fourfold damages. Personal slavery for debt was permitted, but
the physical well-being of the slave was protected.
These three examples from the earliest days of historical Babylonia,
Greece, and Rome are enough to support the conclusion that credit at
interest was widespread enough to create major political problems before
the emergence of written history. The entire 5,000-year span of written
history, however, is equal to only about one-half of one percent of the
duration of human life on this planet. People had plenty of time to learn
a lot about credit and interest before they began to write it down.
Moving forward in time, we note that the Capitularies of Charlemagne,
circa 800
A
.
D
., also dealt with credit. They
flatly forbade all
incre
ments on
loans. The sin of usury, and the desire for legal exceptions, provoked
major theological and legal controversies for more than a thousand years
of the Middle Ages. After the Reformation had justified the charging of
interest in northern Europe, the interest rate controversy was taken up
by economists, financiers, and politicians, usually in terms of laissez faire
versus state control. England eventually followed Solon and abandoned
all fixed legal limits on the rate of interest. The states of the United States
in their usury laws set fixed maximum rates of interest and in this respect
continued the legal traditions of Hammurabi and Rome.



Any way you slice it, the banking business is about borrowing cheap and lending dear. The economic question is how that goal set affects the rest of us.








## repo markets

Carolyn Sissoko emphasises that lenders prefer to loan against collateral. If you don't pay them back then they get to take your thing.

Treasury bills are considered so secure that they make good collateral. I get money today while you hold my T-bill. If I don't pay you back with interest then you already have my T-bill and don't need to come looking for me. [^ Believe me --- if you've never run a business --- chasing customers down for money _they already owe you_ --- you've already "made the sale" and done the work --- is a huge pain in the ass and a feature of every business. That is why `accounts receivable` is a major accounting category. People try to wriggle out of paying, for real.]



You'll need to think through the [mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1olbQ4LyfFA) a few times before you get it.

According to Tim Geithner's book _Stress Test_, repo is the main way that hedge funds financed trades. The problem with getting financing from the money markets is that, since the terms change every day, you can't count on them too much. Big companies need a department that does nothing but plan and predict treasury financing. In the crisis of 2008 the money markets just stopped offering companies money. Imagine that you are used to borrowing in ranges like 3, 4, or 5 percent and then one day the market was offering 500 percent at best. If your business runs on debt (most public companies do --- see [[LBO]], requires a lender to go through the basic operations of paying your vendors and employees, shipping your packages and            . Maybe for a while you can put people off. But what if the money markets aren't back next week? next month?


This seems like an important feature of today's economic, capitalistic setup. Because of specialisation most companies rely on a lot of other companies to do necessary parts of their business for them. In fact vertical integration is illegal [^ for other reasons]. Imagine that you ran an auto body shop and one day all the people who supply you with paint are gone. You could only serve the customers with the paint you had left. Maybe you talk them into getting a weird color that's "close"? And then what do you do when the paint suppliers are still gone a month later? Do you try to figure out how to make auto paints yourself? This is just one example of [[general equilibrium]] problems: the disappearance of auto-paint suppliers would cause a ripple effect.

(A couple years ago business academics wrote papers about "hoarding cash" ... not coincidentally journalists in major newspapers were talking about "hoarding cash" ... not coincidentally people and their friends were losing theri jobs, fewer people were hiring, and corporate profits were high. Hence, "stop hoarding cash, you big bad corporations".)

†NB: Madoff! When he was still seen as clean (20**0**2).


"The" market price is a misleading concept.  [^Matters for the "mark to market" geeks. ((delong: "mark our beliefs to market" . economist articles)) If you view the bids & asks as two histograms moving left & right over time and rarely crossing, _across multiple exchanges_, then this is "the market", cheaters and tricksters and all. What is the relevance of the last print --- let's say in a low-volume stock it was two months ago? Or should you use the midpoint of bid & ask? What if there happen to be more tricksters on the upside waiting for dumb people to jump in because of a news story? What if just by chance (or because it's easier to value in their model) someone happens to list way-out limit orders in the ? And how the hell does any of this relate to "bets on opinions" and Surowieckian Intrade market-price fetishism?]


- prints vs non-crossing arguments
- Is it that much more significant when two bids & asks momentarily cross? What about a "continuous" measure based on the nearness of the b & a?
- real estate deals ((("you're talking to the wrong guy" --- story of the handshake --- charisma .... NP comment that friendly midwestern guy and priests do better than NYC rude bond salesmen
- (((and again when it's a conversation power of sales, it's no longer a transaction stripped down only to price and don't care whom you get it from ... small businesses, dealing with family, dealing with repeat clients, etc ...... "mark to market" gfy

Here are the prices that were listed throughout the day.


You can see the "conversation" / "argument" about the value of this stock stays within a remarkably small band. [^So maybe it has to do with the players who were arguing that day? A lot of traders looking to make a tick simply by gaming the others' mistakes or filling random small-lots orders as they came in from individual investors / brokerages, and nobody with a strong opinion about the fundamentals of the company?]







this is "the truth" (at least on that day). When traders talk about a "1000 sigma day" in the Weimar hyperinflation, they mean *this* sigma. (Not the religious "population sigma" of bell curve veneration)
