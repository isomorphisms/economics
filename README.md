Facts I think "everyone should know". I'll try to keep it short and theory-free. That said, this is an _opinionated_ selection of facts. It will be too obvious for some but hopefully not too advanced for anyone. This is what I wish someone would have told me X years ago.


I am generally going to speak about the US economy. That's not because it is the only economy, it's just where I have the most information about. It is a really large and important economy. It's also one of the most successful economies of the 20th century, so not representative of the whole. Maybe I'll add other information later.

If you disagree with me, send a pull request. If you can improve my writing, send a pull request. If you have facts to add, send a pull request with sources. Thanks.

### Pay

Competitive labor markets are meant to empower workers exactly when employers are forced to pay more. For example:

> My wife has learned that if she is unable to assure her employees that they will earn a total of at least $100 a day, nobody will work for her.

![capitalism vs communism](http://36.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzdx1tJidd1qc38e9o2_1280.png)

Because of the stark differences between North & South Korea, East & West Germany, Taiwan & 大陆, and pre/post Deng Xiaoping's "opening" of China, you cannot argue that capitalism does not create greater wealth than communism.

Capitalism created wealth in the 20th century. Communism created less and they had access to the same technology. Greater wealth means an easier and more comfortable life. So there is something that we want about capitalism. But what exactly is it? And how much of the bad stuff can we get rid of?

You don't need to adopt ad-hoc views about government versus corporate management. There might be some differences between the people who go into one versus the other, but the stereotypes about college sophomore hippies who read Saul Alinsky versus the red-blooded business students who misunderstand Gordon Gekko's purpose in _Wall Street_ (www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArS16ZyOxLQ) ---- are lazy, insufficient guides to characterise government vs business. Both are complex organisations. Both employ lazy risk-haters. Both require layers of communication and compromise. Both work with other people's money. Businessmen often serve on city councils. Etc.

A simpler reason that lawmakers shouldn't delve into the details is that it's too hard. Go to a few city council meetings wherever you live. Ask yourself if you are an expert on par with interested parties in:

- how to insulate a home
- the best kind of fire alarms
- how to design roads safely
- how to encourage both positive & negative feedback from the people you serve when you make the wrong call
- how to 


It ain't easy or fun. And people who critique politicians out of hand for being stupid are lazy non-thinkers. Inform yourself or shut up; you have the internet, so you have no excuse.

I will list several ways that various layers of US federalist government intelligently avoid making decisions they are not equipped to make. The desire to devolve decisions is in my opinion a sign of great intelligence on the part of federal and state lawmakers.

I'll give some examples below.

# growth & history

http://www.theworldeconomy.org/

> Over the past millennium, world population rose 22–fold. Per capita income increased 13–fold, world GDP nearly 300–fold. This contrasts sharply with the preceding millennium, when world population grew by only a sixth, and there was no advance in per capita income.

> From the year 1000 to 1820 the advance in per capita income was a slow crawl — the world average rose about 50 per cent. Most of the growth went to accommodate a fourfold increase in population.

> Since 1820, world development has been much more dynamic. Per capita income rose more than eightfold, population more than fivefold.

> Per capita income growth is not the only indicator of welfare. Over the long run, there has been a dramatic increase in life expectation. In the year 1000, the average infant could expect to live about 24 years. A third would die in the first year of life, hunger and epidemic disease would ravage the survivors. There was an almost imperceptible rise up to 1820, mainly in Western Europe. Most of the improvement has occurred since then. Now the average infant can expect to survive 66 years.

> The growth process was uneven in space as well as time. The rise in life expectation and income has been most rapid in Western Europe, North America, Australasia and Japan. By 1820, this group had forged ahead to an income level twice that in the rest of the world. By 1998, the gap was 7:1. Between the United States and Africa the gap is now 20:1. This gap is still widening. Divergence is dominant but not inexorable. In the past half century, resurgent Asian countries have demonstrated that an important degree of catch–up is feasible. Nevertheless world economic growth has slowed substantially since 1973, and the Asian advance has been offset by stagnation or retrogression elsewhere.

### Mastery of Energy

http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/ahtt.html

[[[figures]]]

> The life forms on our planet have necessarily evolved to match the
magnitude of these energy flows. But while “natural man” is in balance
with these heat flows, “technological man”1 has used his mind, his back,
and his will to harness and control energy flows that are far more intense
than those we experience naturally. To emphasize this point we suggest
that the reader make an experiment.


> Experiment 1.1
Generate as much power as you can, in some way that permits you to
measure your own work output. You might lift a weight, or run your own
weight up a stairwell, against a stopwatch. Express the result in watts (W).
Perhaps you might collect the results in your class. They should generally
be less than 1 kW or even 1 horsepower (746 W). How much less might
be surprising.

> Thus, when we do so small a thing as turning on a 150 W light bulb,
we are manipulating a quantity of energy substantially greater than a
human being could produce in sustained effort. The power consumed
by an oven, toaster, or hot water heater is an order of magnitude beyond
our capacity. The power consumed by an automobile can easily be three
orders of magnitude greater. If all the people in the United States worked
continuously like galley slaves, they could barely equal the output of even
a single city power plant.
Our voracious appetite for energy has steadily driven the intensity
of actual heat transfer processes upward until they are far greater than
those normally involved with life forms on earth. Until the middle of the
thirteenth century, the energy we use was drawn indirectly from the sun
1
Some anthropologists think that the term Homo technologicus (technological man)
serves to define human beings, as apart from animals, better than the older term Homo
sapiens (man, the wise). We may not be as much wiser than the animals as we think we
are, but only we do serious sustained tool making.


> using comparatively gentle processes — animal power, wind and water
power, and the combustion of wood. Then population growth and defor-
estation drove the English to using coal. By the end of the seventeenth
century, England had almost completely converted to coal in place of
wood. At the turn of the eighteenth century, the first commercial steam
engines were developed, and that set the stage for enormously increased
consumption of coal. Europe and America followed England in these
developments.
The development of fossil energy sources has been a bit like Jules
Verne’s description in Around the World in Eighty Days in which, to win
a race, a crew burns the inside of a ship to power the steam engine. The
combustion of nonrenewable fossil energy sources (and, more recently,
the fission of uranium) has led to remarkably intense energy releases in
power-generating equipment. The energy transferred as heat in a nuclear
reactor is on the order of one million watts per square meter.

So one way to think about then versus now is that the industrial revolution gave us power generation and power consumption.

So we can't necessarily solve pollution by better engineering, or at least people will work against us.

# banking

Does finance serve any useful purpose? The first way to argue it does is to think about home loans.



(The bank will repossess your house if you get too far behind on your mortgage. However they will likely take a loss so it is bad for both parties. Otherwise you could expect that banks would loan to whomever. If they could resell the house at face then a mortgage would involve no risk to them so they would just do it as much as possible. [[student loans tkacik]]







Over time consumer credit has expanded into car loans and credit-card loans. [[[frb research on cc debt]]]





- aaron brown on derivatives as the new money
- Tkacik student loans







Any way you slice it, the banking business is about borrowing cheap and lending dear. The economic question is how that goal set affects the rest of us.








## repo markets

Carolyn Sissoko emphasises that lenders prefer to loan against collateral. If you don't pay them back then they get to take your thing.

Treasury bills are considered so secure that they make good collateral. I get money today while you hold my T-bill. If I don't pay you back with interest then you already have my T-bill and don't need to come looking for me. [^ Believe me --- if you've never run a business --- chasing customers down for money _they already owe you_ --- you've already "made the sale" and done the work --- is a huge pain in the ass and a feature of every business. That is why `accounts receivable` is a major accounting category. People try to wriggle out of paying, for real.]



You'll need to think through the [mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1olbQ4LyfFA) a few times before you get it.

- libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2011/04/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-tri-party-repo-market-but-didnt-know-to-ask.html
- geithner

According to Tim Geithner's book _Stress Test_, repo is the main way that hedge funds financed trades. The problem with getting financing from the money markets is that, since the terms change every day, you can't count on them too much. Big companies need a department that does nothing but plan and predict treasury financing. In the crisis of 2008 the money markets just stopped offering companies money. Imagine that you are used to borrowing in ranges like 3, 4, or 5 percent and then one day the market was offering 500 percent at best. If your business runs on debt (most public companies do --- see [[LBO]], requires a lender to go through the basic operations of paying your vendors and employees, shipping your packages and            _____. Maybe for a while you can put people off. But what if the money markets aren't back next week? next month?


This seems like an important feature of today's economic, capitalistic setup. Because of specialisation most companies rely on a lot of other companies to do necessary parts of their business for them. In fact vertical integration is illegal [^ for other reasons]. Imagine that you ran an auto body shop and one day all the people who supply you with paint are gone. You could only serve the customers with the paint you had left. Maybe you talk them into getting a weird color that's "close"? And then what do you do when the paint suppliers are still gone a month later? Do you try to figure out how to make auto paints yourself? This is just one example of [[general equilibrium]] problems: the disappearance of auto-paint suppliers would cause a ripple effect.

[^ Microsoft is an exception [[link]] ]








# bonds

Every year $__ trillion worth of bonds change hands globally.

For comparison the sum total value of all public companies [^ NB: calculating the price based on the marginal is not really correct because as you tried to sell all of the company's shares, the price might change.] is ~~. And ____ changes hands each year.


###### capital structure

Companies are owned by shareholders (equity, which is traded in the New York Stock Exchange [[[pic]]], Frankfurt, ....) 


Some shareholders are mutual funds, pensions, or ETF's. In other words groups that have pooled their money together to own fractions of many companies [^and perhaps own fractions of other things, like forests [[[link]]] or future claims on [[[cow types /// wheat types]]] --- the other things might trade in a different location like Chicago or Kansas City.]




Companies also borrow money. Borrowing = − debt = bonds. Equity = ownership = shares &ne; bonds.





##### sameness and securitisation

In order to bring things to a market they need to be similar. Commodity exchanges for example have a lot of rules about what the delivered product needs to be.


[[[brahmin cows]]]]

[[[gold delivery ]]]


[[[fcoj history ... https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/ICE_FCOJ_Brochure.pdf ... http://www.ultimatecitrus.com/pdf/fcoj.pdf ... brown



Think about rice. Only if the rices are all equivalated somehow can they be mixed together and sold en masse. If they can be mixed together then third-parties can trade it even if they don't want or make rice.

For example wheat traders do not want to take delivery, they simply "make a market" for wheat. Pit traders would aggressively buy and sell slips of paper worth ____ bushels of wheat to each other throughout the day, speculating on the ultimate value at delivery.

With things like steel people go to a lot of cost and might actually destroy value, to bring the steel to market. Say you have an awesome steel sculpture. If you can't find someone who agrees it is awesome and sell it to them and deliver it to them, you might melt it down so that its only value is as a commodity.





###### RMBS's

It's this drive to make things exchangeable at a unified trading point that makes it so hard to get a mortgage if you're self-employed. Maybe it is or isn't true that a W-2 job is more stable than the higher-paying 1099 one you have. What is sold on (in packets of 10,000 mortgages at a time [[[link]]) and traded to third-party financial institutions is a conforming mortgage.

Local banks don't need to, themselves, hold enough money to buy every house in town. If they originate conforming mortgages and sell them on to people who *do* have boatloads of money, then they have a repeatable, scalable, fee-based business. Each conforming mortgage is so many dollars. It's a uniform process like an assembly line. It doesn't mean your job isn't valid, just that people who don't fit in the box are harder to pack together and sell as a conforming packet of 10,000.

######Fairness

Is it unfair of them not to loan you money? If I were a conservative I would say it's their prerogative and nobody owes you a loan, however the US has laws that make certain businesses to some extent public institutions. Even if you want to rent a room in your home you are not allowed to discriminate on certain bases. [[[craigslist -- fair housing]]]

Some people like to pretend fairness isn't part of it but in a lawful society it is. We also regulate exchanges and securities offerings. You can't just do whatever you want, sort of like how you can't hire a hit man or tell certain kinds of lies with certain kinds of products. (For example you can lie about supplements all you want, but not about food or drugs.)

In general the law balances freedom with fairness. Capitalism as we know it exists only within a system of laws, and capitalism as we know it has never arisen outside a system of laws. It would be inconceivable to make the kind of money Warren Buffett has made without policies to protect fairly earned wealth. Imagine two boys playing by themselves with no adults around. They make a bet for five dollars. The one who loses refuses to pay and they punch each other. No money is exchanged. This is what I think would happen instead of a carefully regulated system of trust that is necessary for the function of exchanges like the CME. [[[[link to CME stuff




###### labour markets are not markets

If labour markets were like the CME, then you would be able to buy and sell large packs of "work units", let's say 10,000 hours per contract. It would not have to be "generic work". We don't trade "generic cows" or "generic oil" or "generic steel" either. 


For this reason I do not believe "the labour market" is a market in the usual sense of the word.


I've seen market-like things in labour. For example day-labourers will all show up at a an appointed place at 5 in the morning and then scramble for work as whoever that wants "generic manual labour" and can pay cash same-day picks them up in a truck and drives off to the job site. But I think as skills diversify even a little [[[free grou picyture]]] it stops working this way. If you're a flooring expert or an electrician or a journeyman anything, there ceases to be a gathering-market and it starts to look more like the familiar office-work pattern of sending résumés / curriculum vit&aelig; and establishing long-term relationships.

###### retail is not a market

Stores in the United States post an offer and you cannot haggle it. Bix box stores contain loads of goods from just one company. Their suppliers may compete with each other but at the consumer end once you're inside Wal Mart you are probably going to buy most of your stuff there. You would have to hoof it across town and you can't see what's in the other store so might as well go with the W. [^ This is a point where I think rationalistic economist models are irrelevant. Rational purchasing may happen over the long run ---- whatever that means --- or it may happen at the supplier level where Wal-Mart squeezes greater profits by muscling against its suppliers. However that is in the back end not at the direct consumer end.]

Stores are also "designed, not emergent". The ladies with the spices can sit wherever they want and readjust throughout the day. The buyer can saunter around. Grocery stores are the complete opposite, they have experts deciding "from the top down" [^fugly 90's speak] what to put next to each other on the shelves.

![future money](future money.png)


That is the cost of future money. For example on `Sys.Date() == 2015-07-31` the yield on 1-year Treasury notes is `0.36%`, which means that $100 will become $100.36 and $10,000 will become $10,036 in one year's time. If you spent $10,000 on 1-years that day you would receive $10,036 in one year's time.

due to Catherine Mulbrandon: http://visualizingeconomics.com/blog/2006/11/05/2005-us-income-distribution

Notice that:
1. not only do half of the households get by on less than $40k / year, there arearound just a ton of people who (combined, if multiple people work in the home) earn $20k or $30k.
2. the rich live in their own world [^ I think you would need a `log(log($))` scale to fit the rich.]

People who index around $100k or complain about how there exist others who make more money than they do (doctors, corporate lawyers, investment bankers, currency traders, whatever) are living in a bubble. Normal Americans make $20k or $30k. (If you assume full-time work = 50 weeks × 40 hours/week = 2000 hours/year, then that would be $10/hour – $15/hour. Normal.)


There are some reasons the $0/year households aren't dead: they might be retired and living off of savings, or they might have negative business income for the year but generally be rich. [[mpls fed]]

Anyway. It's the $10/hr - $15/hr number that we should be interested in increasing. In a capitalist world that means empowering those people. Their productivity needs to go up and/or they need to capture more of what they already produce.

This young man seems to me like a totally nice person—the exact kind you don't want to see pulled in by the "logic" of supposedly hard-headed econ-baiters.

######What's the fastest way to make a million dollars?

Obviously: marry someone with two million dollars. The paperwork for marriage is faster than insurance settlements, because insurance companies will always battle you in court to not give you the money. [[quote]]




You can't sideline inheritance 

It's a fundamental human right to be able to do what you want with your own money. (That's what "your money" is, right?) But actually, no. You can't hire a hitman, nor should you be able to. And the government steps in to take taxes http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2008/05/nye_on_wine_war.html to finance things. And it should do so. [[because..

[[cultural clout --- PG submarine // buying ideology time]]



It is way easier to produce and deliver software now than it was 20 years ago. Languages are better, the internet is a well developed physical delivery network, browsers are really good and everybody has one, smart phones are really good [[[penetration is ....]], ad networks ... , computational power is cheap and you can easily increment/decrement your purchase on 

Not that people have web business models figured out. Or know what you, the fickle consumer, want. Or have even figured out ad targeting to the point that was promised in the 90's. [diulbert]

##### general equilibrium

You can probably imagine what would happen if small economic changes were made in your workplace, your friends' lives, your community. What would you do with a 5% raise?

But what if the minimum wage were multiplied by ten? What if not only you got a million dollars, but so did everyone on your street? Big changes are harder to think about. The reaction to the initial "stimulus" (let's say it's a law) might become really important too.





##### life goals

Guru jerks will tell you that you should become rich enough to live off interest. This doesn't make sense for a variety of reasons, for example the obvious that if you can earn $20,000/year as a 2% coupon. Or that you risk spoiling your kids [[link]]. Or that work is not really that bad. But anyway it's all part of a pervasive ideology that wants to venerate wealth and capitalist achievement. Perhaps not surprising when buildings and chairs are named after capitalist donors rather than those who excelled in a field of human endeavour.

It's the kind of thing that makes sense if you think about it for a minute, but not if you think about it for a long time.






##### Long Term Capital Management

This is a hedge fund whose blowup had systemic consequences.

George Loewenstein's book notes that LTCM enjoyed lower haircuts because everyone wanted to do business with them.

This is consistent with
1. Aaron Brown's [[[[and many others]]]]] assertion that execution, details, and terms of trade are what make for successful profit margins---fighting over every last basis point.
2. Renaissance job postings for tax advisors. Again, tax savings are risk-free basis points.

##### median wage growth vs wage growth for _me_

I don't want to waste too much time lampooning economists because I could go on forever about that and it's probably better to just point to the stuff you _should_ read, rather than waste time engaging with the un-serious. I'll just point out that growth in the median (middle) purchasing power is a _proxy_ for an easier, better life for "people", but then again so is the purchasing power of the lowest person. It's not even possible to rank-order these things----but my preferred measure is the power, freedom, and quality-of-life of "the least among you". We can at least get closer by looking at the 10th-percentile wage instead of the 50th-percentile.

Stay away while a newbie. The VIX is not a "fear index", and your home or rental price is not affected by "market information".





###### FUD

There is an unbelievable amount of FUD, deception, and downright evil in economics debates. From think tanks that are funded by rich people


The worst example I know of
http://isomorphism.es/post/46010268277/the-opportunity-to-get-rich-to-attain-unto-great
Russell Horton Cownay, an evil guru who got rich selling self-hatred and cheapo advice (under the guise of Christianity no less!) to working-class Americans. He got enough money doing this to start his own university, Temple University in Philadelphia.


Of course there are also just a lot of bad rich people in history.

I don't know why the Quoran Reddit half of the internet thinks that capitalists are heroes and #hackdisrupt is David vs Goliath. I suspect it's just as little self-criticism as the Robert Reich half of the internet that thinks a survey of what Americans think the "fair income distribution should be" is a meaningful comment on the ideal ethical state, or people who cite Rawls, Nietzsche, Marx, or Judith Butler on any topic as if the opinion of an intellectual proves something.
