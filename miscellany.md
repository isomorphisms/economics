#### newsy issues

I started ranting about some stuff while I was writing the main section. I can't really consider this "need to know" information and I said I would keep the main section short. However I feel like I can provide some warnings that you will hopefully benefit from.





###### career and avocation

What job areas pay well? What does it mean in terms of the feeling-of-life to have a job that pays well, or poorly? What about "starving artists who are happy"? What about adjunct professors of theatre who work at a liquor store on the side .... for 20 years ... before getting a shot at a full-time "real job"?

What is the emotional life-cycle that goes along with middle-class life (job, marriage, house, kids, retirement)? How do the bo-ho's who step aside for a braver death feel in their day-to-day doings, what's it like to "be a poet" and work in the same kitchen for 25 years without any recognition of your greatness? [[See again my notes about poet laureates and where they com from economically.  [[brodsky.  harvard brooklyn couple i read about.]] ...]]

As I said at the top I'm writing this for a 16- or 19-year-old and I think the flimsy suppositions about work's effect on life are as powerful today as they were when I was that age.

- financing of a home (interest payments)

- amy poehler "you'll make it ... your friends getting houses and married"
- GNU dude .. superiority
- pg & vc's .. muy self-satisfied
- henry f
- danielson

- munilass "a résumé doesn't keep them warm at night"
- thiel 'the cycle never stops"

Obviously this is the area where I have the least ability to say something universally true. It's also the most important. I guess my opinion I would most like to convince you of, because I think the opposite view is virulent oison, is that

- profession is not personality 
- (fuck "marry an architect because they have the best of both art and science" ... I can't believe mature people actually think that
- avocation does not need to be vocation (tweet : "do what you love and you'll never have a weekend off in your life" // tshirt: "I suffer from cruel and unusual employment")

 

##### HFT and "fake liquidity"

- asness (Wrong)
- Blair Hull [describes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEQ7a_JwWTg) "fake liquidity" where traders stand on queue only if they're at the front. If a big order comes in behind them and pushes them through, then it will hopefully be a big enough order that you can turn right around and go the other direction, making a tick in the process. 
- haim bodek (not respected) describes something similar
- eric hunsader and sal xxxx are not respected by industry people
- mech markets https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/01/13/trader-type-and-order-age/
- alexandre laumonier is respected by indsutry people https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/. An anthropologist, if you follow through his links you can see marketing by Mackay Brothers, who sell the microwave towers.

######EITC

Milton Friedman's alternative to the minimum wage is to pay low wage workers instead of taxing them. Even though he was a conservative, Friedman never thought the negative tax on low-paid workers was high enough during his lifetime.

Software companies aren't "more ethical" than fast food companies because their employees happen to be white collar. Actually it's maybe the other way around, since providing employment to the least powerful is a social good. Anyway, however you slice it, poverty is everyone's problem, so everyone should contribute.

A negative tax has the further upside that it increases tax-filing rates, and the further downside that you don't want your income to come all at once during the year, especially if you are scraping by.





##### venture capital


Luigi Zingales, a "professor of entrepreneurship and risk" who has taken no risks and never started a company, cites venture capital as a great example of an American success story

It is way easier to produce and deliver software now than it was 20 years ago. Languages are better, the internet is a well developed physical delivery network, browsers are really good and everybody has one, smart phones are really good [[[penetration is ....]], ad networks ... , computational power is cheap and you can easily increment/decrement your purchase on 

Not that people have web business models figured out. Or know what you, the fickle consumer, want. Or have even figured out ad targeting to the point that was promised in the 90's. [diulbert]

##### general equilibrium

You can probably imagine what would happen if small economic changes were made in your workplace, your friends' lives, your community. What would you do with a 5% raise?

But what if the minimum wage were multiplied by ten? What if not only you got a million dollars, but so did everyone on your street? Big changes are harder to think about. The reaction to the initial "stimulus" (let's say it's a law) might become really important too.





##### life goals

Guru jerks will tell you that you should become rich enough to live off interest. This doesn't make sense for a variety of reasons, for example the obvious that if you can earn $20,000/year as a 2% coupon. Or that you risk spoiling your kids [[link]]. Or that work is not really that bad. But anyway it's all part of a pervasive ideology that wants to venerate wealth and capitalist achievement. Perhaps not surprising when buildings and chairs are named after capitalist donors rather than those who excelled in a field of human endeavour.

It's the kind of thing that makes sense if you think about it for a minute, but not if you think about it for a long time.






##### Long Term Capital Management

This is a hedge fund whose blowup had systemic consequences.

George Loewenstein's book notes that LTCM enjoyed lower haircuts because everyone wanted to do business with them.

This is consistent with
1. Aaron Brown's [[[[and many others]]]]] assertion that execution, details, and terms of trade are what make for successful profit margins---fighting over every last basis point.
2. Renaissance job postings for tax advisors. Again, tax savings are risk-free basis points.

##### median wage growth vs wage growth for _me_

I don't want to waste too much time lampooning economists because I could go on forever about that and it's probably better to just point to the stuff you _should_ read, rather than waste time engaging with the un-serious. I'll just point out that growth in the median (middle) purchasing power is a _proxy_ for an easier, better life for "people", but then again so is the purchasing power of the lowest person. It's not even possible to rank-order these things----but my preferred measure is the power, freedom, and quality-of-life of "the least among you". We can at least get closer by looking at the 10th-percentile wage instead of the 50th-percentile.

###### "information" and "volatility"

Stay away while a newbie. The VIX is not a "fear index", and your home or rental price is not affected by "market information".





###### FUD

There is an unbelievable amount of FUD, deception, and downright evil in economics debates. From think tanks that are funded by rich people


The worst example I know of
http://isomorphism.es/post/46010268277/the-opportunity-to-get-rich-to-attain-unto-great
Russell Horton Cownay, an evil guru who got rich selling self-hatred and cheapo advice (under the guise of Christianity no less!) to working-class Americans. He got enough money doing this to start his own university, Temple University in Philadelphia.


Of course there are also just a lot of bad rich people in history.

- Alfred Nobel
- William Andrews Clark, copper monopolist, senator, marrier of women 60 years his junior, in the words of Mark Twain "as rotten a human being as can be found anywhere under the flag; he is a shame to the American nation, and no one has helped to send him to the Senate who did not know that his proper place was the penitentiary, with a ball and chain on his legs. To my mind he is the most disgusting creature that the republic has produced since Tweed's time", Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_A._Clark#Political_career Clark County, Nevada is named after him.
- Cecil Rhodes, racist, colonialist, 

Wait, the Rhodes of Rhodes Scholarship? You betcha... 


Why is Stanford called Stanford? It's named after Leland Stanford, a monopolist.....

I don't know why the Quoran Reddit half of the internet thinks that capitalists are heroes and #hackdisrupt is David vs Goliath. I suspect it's just as little self-criticism as the Robert Reich half of the internet that thinks a survey of what Americans think the "fair income distribution should be" is a meaningful comment on the ideal ethical state, or people who cite Rawls, Nietzsche, Marx, or Judith Butler on any topic as if the opinion of an intellectual proves something.

You can come back and convince me with a pull request. ]





At the same time, governments with at least a few of their citizens watching have made a lot of data freely available. (You are probably just not looking at it because you're lazy and ignorant.)

it means they are measuring mass behaviour

You can derive this yourself and should. Write out the terms and then draw a big box around them, call the box `F`, and then do `fF−F`.

###### CAPM and portfolio maths

Don't spend too much time on the CAPM. It's contentious theory [Buffett link].

Sums of independent dice are Gaussian distributed.  (My blog post on it.) So if the price evolution were totally random it would still be a bit mean centric.

Look at _differences_ in stock prices to see how the daily change is usually bounded. Look at [[this data example]] to see the "discussion" over price of some security over a trading day. (At tick level.) [[histo]]


This tick data looks much more to me like I would imagine a bazaar in Tashkent, except electronic so everybody "goes to the market" with computers from their offices. Meaning more people can be there at once, which seems like a good thing.

[^Gaussian probability is roughly proportional ½ to the distance from the average. So 1/2, 1/4, 1/8. We measure in square-root of distance so these numbers become 0σ ∝ 1, 1σ ∝ 1/4, 2σ≈1/16 ]

###### black scholes

watch out also when people start talking too much about black scholes.

- heading toward the blue
- quant.se
- NP: wrong, wrong, wrong

Like I said there is a lot, lot, lot of F.U.D. in finance. People at least think they can become important by saying stuff that's over your head and you can't critique it. Just don't bother. All you need to know is that BSM is an approximation. In maths terms I would just say it provides a better coördinate system (IV's) for traders, than dollars or percents. IV is a better scale for options traders to have their discussion in; things make better sense to both sides, it essentially cuts out a calculation that both sides would have to do anyway. The idea that traders worship the BSM model the way academics do is … what do you call it when you accuse someone else of committing the sin you commit? Freudian Transference?


###### options

Options on the other hand are not so complex. Buying a call north of the spot means you are bullish on a stock and expect it to end north of where it is today. (Calls have a fixed expiration date.) You need to pay premium to the seller for them to sell you the right to call them in the future.

You can also sell options

[m0ar theta ken griffin boat]
[scammy "retirement plan" guy]

I thought about paying my rent this way when I was poor ("Wait ... I can just *have money*? Hellz yea!"), but they don't let poor people insure stock market players. You need to have tens of thousands of dollars at least (more like tens of millions if you want to trade for a living), and the exchange asks you for margin every time a position moves against you. In other words the exchange is going to make sure you are good for the money
in case it expires ITM before they let you insure someone. This is one of the things the exchange does to make sure people from both sides want to trade there. (I.e., not the boys in the schoolyard punching each other because they aren't actually good for their word.)

###### libraries

ok, getting really far afield here. But software (esp web) is hot right now.

Libraries are more important than languages. A library is code that someone else has already written that you can just call. For example it takes a lot of code to TCP/IP/UDP/serve/client/parse a HTML GET request [link] that's sent over the web. But a library like `curl` does it for you. `curl` is xyz lines long, it's been used by a lot of people, it's been edited by a lot of knowledgeable hackers. So just use that with a "scripting language" (a.k.a. an easy language) and in a few
lines you can do what you want to do. For example look at bastards book of ruby.

#### people who confuse "the stock market" with "the economy"

Run, don't walk, away from these people. `XOM` is the largest component of the S&P with a market cap of __ (all 500 companies total __). [[source]]

North Americans do invest preferentially in the NYSE and NASDAQ (cite). So for those with significant equity holdings [^remember this skews rich. Approximately top 20% [[cite]], although it's certainly possible for others to shop down in house price and stick money in the stock market.] their retirement savings / bequeathals / endowments will drop when the S&P drops.

#### "tail risk" and "short-term profits"


long term profits don't exist. neither do tails when you're collecting premium. Unless the trader knows intuitively that the good times can't last or that it's a very risky move. (buying HY)

But let's say you run a composite strategy whose tenth portfolio moments are not obvious.

## scams and liars


Some people are on your side. Most people are indifferent to you but will be polite to you. Some people dislike you personally. And then there are evil people who want to murder and cheat whoever falls into their fly trap.

Here are some screen shots of stock market scammers.



If you take money from people who produce value at a real job, then you'll never have to work a day in your life.
